# Data Science Toolkits and Architectures - *Milestone 1*


## 0. Setting up a virtual Machine with Ubuntu

### 0.1 Installing VS Code 
What is VS Code, and how did we installed it? VS Code is a source code editor in which you can open multiple tabs.
Furthermore, VS Code has a build-in support for Git, which will make it easy for us to commit code, 
create branches, and push/pull to our Github repo from VS Code. 
We installed VS Code through the App Center in the Ubuntu server on the Virtual Machine.

### 0.2 Install Python extension in VS Code
First, we need to ensure if Python is already installed on the Linux system.
We use the command 'python3 --version' to see if python3 is already installed.
In the terminal we get an error message that it is not installed so we use 'sudo apt install python3'.
Also we immediately use 'sudo apt update' to update to the latest python version possible which is Python 3.12.0.

### 0.3 Install Git extension in VS Code
To install Git on VS Code we used 'sudo apt install git'. 

### 0.4 Creating a new directory on Ubuntu
Before making a new directory on Ubuntu we first see in which directory we are currently working.
This is done by the command pwd, meaning print working directory.
The new working directory will be called DSTA, referring to the name of the course.
To make this directory we use 'mkdir DSTA'.
If we want to make changes in that directory we use 'cd DSTA' to set our working directory to that folder.
In the terminal we also see now that we are working in the DSTA folder.

### 0.5 Making changes in Git
Eventually we want to make changes that will be visible in our repositorty on Github.
Therefore, we use the command 'git clone' with the link of our repository. So we make changes in git.
Because we want to work in this directory we set 'cd ...' witht the link of our repository. 
We use the 'Tab' button to make our life easier and not type the full link again.
Now the changes will be made for all the files in the current directory.
