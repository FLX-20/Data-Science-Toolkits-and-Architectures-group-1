# Data Science Toolkits and Architectures - *Milestone 1*


## 0. Setting up a virtual Machine with Ubuntu

## 1. MNIST-Dataset

## 2. Checking Git Code Base

## 3. Git and Github workflow
In this chapter we would like to write down our git and github workflow quickly, starting from with an empty folder.

### 3.1 Clone/copy a repository from Github
You can copy a GitHub repository on your machine using the following command.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/FLX-20/Data-Science-Toolkits-and-Architectures-group-1.git
```
It clones/copes all files, commits history and branches from the repository located in the cloud on Git Hub into a new directory on your computer. Thus it creates a local copy of the project.

## 4. Running Python Code

## 5. Explaining Convolutional Neural Networks

## 6. Adding Documentation

## 7. Creating a folder for this milestone
