# Milestone 3

## Task 1 - Setting Up Docker Compose








## Task 2 - Simple PostgreSQL Application

a) What is PostgreSQL? SQL or NoSQL
It is a RDBMS, which is short for relational database management system - it uses SQL, which is short for structured query language to access, define and manipulate data. Furthermore the ACID structure, referring to the data points being Atomic, Consistent, Isolated and Durable is another sign for the SQL nature of PosegreSQL. As such it is SQL as the data is stored in a structured way in tables with rows and columns and Primary as well as Foreign Keys are utilized.

b) If the container was stopped  and started again the joke would still be in the Database, yes, because the data memory is not-volatile, meaning it can persist through restarts or even power outtages. This means that the joke will still persist, as it does after one has used "stop" and "start" commands to restart the container, because docker volumes remain even after the corresponding container stops. 






## Task 3 - Loading and Saving Images in PostgreSQL Database







## Task 4 - Multi-Docker Container Application
