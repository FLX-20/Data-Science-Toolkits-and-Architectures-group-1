# Milestone 5

## Task 1 Flask Tutorial
We perfomed the 
[tutorial] (https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-build-and-deploy-a-flask-application-using-docker-on-ubuntu-18-04) 
given in Task 1 of milestone 5 in an Ubuntu shell. The version of Ubuntu that we used is 22.04.3. When deploying a 
Flask application with Docker allows us to replicate an application across different servers. During this 
tutorial we have created and deployed a Flask application to a Docker container. Furtermore, we configured the 
`touch-reload` command to refresh the application without starting container. The biggest struggle at first
was to how to save and exit the Nano because there were so many possibility of key bindings. Later we discovered
that pasting the code in the file, using `ctrl + o` to save it, pressing `enter` to confirm, and press `ctrl + x`
to exit. Ones we knew how this worked the tutorial was easy and interesting.
