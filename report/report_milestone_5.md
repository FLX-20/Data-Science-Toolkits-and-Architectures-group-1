# Milestone 5

## Task 1 Flask Tutorial
We perfomed the 
[tutorial] (https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-build-and-deploy-a-flask-application-using-docker-on-ubuntu-18-04) 
given in Task 1 of milestone 5 in an Ubuntu shell. The version of Ubuntu that we used is 22.04.3. During this 
tutorial we created and deployed a Flask application to a Docker
container. Furtermore, we configured the `touch-reload` command to refresh the application without starting 
container.
