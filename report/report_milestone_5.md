# Milestone 5

## Task 1 Flask Tutorial
We performed the 
[tutorial] (https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-build-and-deploy-a-flask-application-using-docker-on-ubuntu-18-04) 
given in Task 1 of milestone 5 in an Ubuntu shell. The version of Ubuntu that we used is 22.04.3. When deploying a 
Flask application with Docker allows us to replicate an application across different servers. During this 
tutorial, we have created and deployed a Flask application to a Docker container. Furthermore, we configured the 
`touch-reload` command to refresh the application without starting the container. 
However, the provided tutorial was not enough to build the Flask web application. 
Even with pre-knowledge in Flask, it was necessary to look things up in the [flask documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) as well as refresh the knowledge with other tutorials. The best tutorial, which included most of the knowledge needed to succeed in this project was found on YouTube on the channel [Caleb Curry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbLc5a9jdXo), which explains the REST API understandably and also builds a Flask application to describes it.
