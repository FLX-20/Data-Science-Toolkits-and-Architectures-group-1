# Milestone 5
In the beginning, the fifth milestone was divided into two main tasks. 
The first task involved developing the Flask application, which includes both the API and the web frontend. This is described in detail in chapters two and three.  
The second part of the milestone focused on adjusting the backend, which was developed over the previous four milestones. Our backend was designed to classify any image dataset from external sources. However, for the current milestone, we only need to classify the MNIST images, which are already included in the Keras package.   
Thus, the entire codebase can be simplified since all functions related to reading external data are no longer necessary. If those functions are needed again, they can be retrieved from the git history. This decision was made to make the application as lightweight as possible and avoid unnecessary code that does not contribute to the productive code.  
Additionally, the Flask application and the modified backend are merged in the end to create a coherent web application consisting of several containers.
